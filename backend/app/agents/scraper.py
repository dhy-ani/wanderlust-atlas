"""Web-search agent: a "what's trending/worth seeing" signal sourced from Reddit's
public JSON API (no auth needed for read-only search — no login, no app
registration). This is deliberately NOT Instagram: Instagram has no public API for
third-party location/hashtag search, so pulling its content means scraping against
their Terms of Service — fragile (breaks on every layout change), gets IPs
blocked, and carries real legal exposure. Reddit's search is a legitimate,
documented, stable alternative for the same "what do real travelers say is worth
seeing" signal.

Results are cached (cache.py) since the same destination gets asked about
repeatedly across negotiations — no point re-hitting Reddit every time.
