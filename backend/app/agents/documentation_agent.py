"""The Documentation Agent: turns a NegotiationResult into a clear, human
-readable narrative of WHY the group ended up where it did — which twin
rejected what and why, what the mediator swapped in response, and how the
score moved round to round. This is deliberately NOT an LLM call: everything
it needs (verdicts, reasoning strings, scores) was already captured for free
by the rule-based scorer or the batched LLM call that already happened during
negotiation — narrating it again with another LLM call would just be spending
money to reformat text we already have. If you want a more natural-prose
version later, that's a good candidate for ONE extra cached call, but the
deterministic version below covers the actual ask: a transparent record of the
agents' reasoning, not another opinion.
